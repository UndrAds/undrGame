Who has never dreamed of soaring freely in the sky like a bird? Parrot Simulator gives you the chance to live vicariously through a colorful parrot on a tropical island. This online game, hosted on UndrPlay, is part of the popular animal simulator series developed by CyberGoldFinch.

## Game Overview

Parrot Simulator is more than just a flight simulator. You take on the life of a parrot, interacting with the world around and the other creatures on the island. The game is set in a lively and vibrant environment, teeming with life and bursting with color.

One of the main attractions of the game is its open-world design, where you can fly around freely and explore various locations. The game world is very immersive, with detailed graphics that show off the beauty of the island.

## Key Features

### Beautiful Open World

The game's open world invites you to explore its every nook and cranny. You can fly over lush rainforests, soar above majestic waterfalls, and perch on tropical trees.

### Interactive Environment

The island is bustling with animal life. You'll be able to interact with other birds, animals, and even human inhabitants of the island. You can choose to be friendly with them or cause some mischief.

### Day and Night Cycle

Parrot Simulator includes a day and night cycle, adding an extra layer of realism to the game. The island transforms from a vibrant paradise in daylight to a serene, moonlit landscape at night.

### Realistic Flight Mechanics

The game takes flight simulation seriously. You'll need to master the art of taking off, landing, and controlling your flight path. It's challenging but incredibly satisfying once you get the hang of it.

## Gameplay Details

The game mechanics are straightforward:

| Action  | Key   |
|---------|-------|
| Fly     | WASD  |
| Land    | Space |
| Interact| E     |
| Call    | Q     |

Use WASD to control your flight direction. Try to land gently using the space bar. You can interact with other characters or objects using the E key, and Q is for making your parrot call.
