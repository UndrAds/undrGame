If you're in the mood for a casual survival simulator, then Raft Life is a game to consider. You start alone on a raft in the middle of the ocean and must use your wit and survival skills to craft, build, and expand your raft, all while fending off occasional shark attacks.

## Game Overview

Raft Life is a survival simulator game where you are left to your own devices in the middle of the vast ocean.
