## Game Overview

In Stick Defenders, a stickman defense game, you're in charge of a bunch of stickmen soldiers. Your task is to protect your base from the oncoming enemy attacks. The enemy will come in waves, and the key to victory lies in your strategy - how you position your soldiers, when you attack, and how you use your resources.

## Key Features

### Varied Units

There are different types of stickmen soldiers, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. You can choose from a variety of units, like archers, swordsmen, magicians, and more. The variety adds another layer to your strategy as you need to deploy the right units to counter the enemy.

### Upgrade System

As you progress in the game, you can upgrade your units and your base. This not only makes your stickmen stronger but also gives you a better chance against the enemy waves.

### Challenging Levels

There are several levels in the game, each presenting a unique challenge. The difficulty increases with each level, keeping you on your toes and making the game engaging.

## Gameplay Details

The game controls are quite simple:

| Action | Key |

Use the mouse to select and deploy your units. You can also select upgrades the same way. Remember, the key to victory lies in how effectively you use these controls.

## Why Play This Game

Stick Defenders is a simple yet engaging game. Its charm lies in its simplicity, strategic gameplay, and the challenge it offers. It's not about flashy graphics or complex mechanics, but about making the right decisions at the right time.

You can lose yourself for hours strategizing your attacks and defenses, and the feeling of victory when you successfully defend your base is truly satisfying. The game is easily accessible and can be played directly in your browser on UndrPlay, without any downloads.

So if you're looking for an engaging strategy game that's easy to pick up but hard to master, Stick Defenders is worth giving a try. Happy gaming!
