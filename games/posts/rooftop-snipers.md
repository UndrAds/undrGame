Rooftop Snipers is a straightforward, action-packed shooting game you can play on UndrPlay. Whether you're going solo or pairing up with a friend, get ready for some chaotic two-button action!

## Game Overview

In Rooftop Snipers, you are quite literally on the edge, standing atop towering buildings and taking precise aim at your opponent on the opposite rooftop. The game's main goal? Knock your rival off their perch with well-placed shots. It's all about timing, precision, and a little bit of chaos.

## Key Features

### Two-Button Gameplay

With just two buttons - one for jumping and one for shooting - Rooftop Snipers keeps things simple. But don't be fooled, mastering the game's mechanics is easier said than done.

### Multiplayer Action

One of the highlights of Rooftop Snipers is the ability to play with a friend. Sharing the keyboard, each player takes control of one sniper in a duel to the last man standing.

### Diverse Range of Characters

Rooftop Snipers features characters from other popular games, enhancing the experience. Each one comes with its unique style and animations, adding a dash of fun to the mix.

## Gameplay Details

The controls are as follows:

| Action | Player 1 Key | Player 2 Key |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Jump   | W            | Up Arrow     |
| Shoot  | E            | P            |

It's all about jumping to dodge bullets and shooting at the right time. Remember, the objective is to knock your opponent off the rooftop, so aim and timing are crucial.

## Why Play This Game

Rooftop Snipers is a blast, especially when playing with a friend. The two-button gameplay might seem simple, but it's all about strategy, timing, and knowing when to jump and when to shoot. 

The game's fun animations and the surprise of seeing familiar characters from other games is an added bonus that keeps things interesting. And thanks to UndrPlay, you can jump into the action anytime, anywhere. So, why not give it a shot? After all, it's not every day you get to duel it out on a rooftop!
