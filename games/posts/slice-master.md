## Game Overview

Slice Master is a casual skill game with one simple objective - slice everything in sight. As the name suggests, you need to master the cutting action, slicing each object that comes your way. But bear in mind, not everything should be sliced.

## Key Features

### Variety of Objects

From fruits to furniture, expect a wide range of objects to slice through. It keeps the game refreshing and the slicing action, oh so satisfying!

### Simple and Fun Gameplay

The game keeps it straightforward. Just slice whatever you see, but remember, there are some things you shouldn't cut. The challenge lies in identifying what to slice and what not to.

### Casual Game Pace

Despite the need for quick reflexes, Slice Master maintains a relaxed pace. It's perfect for those moments when you just want to unwind.

## Gameplay Details

Here are the controls you'll need to know:

| Action | Key |

The game is mouse-dependent. Your slicing speed and precision depend on how quickly and accurately you can maneuver your mouse.
