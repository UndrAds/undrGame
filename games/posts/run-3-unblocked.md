Run 3 is a fast-paced, online running game that's sure to get your heart racing. Your goal is simple - run as far as you can through a series of tunnels in outer space. It's a game of endurance, quick reflexes, and finding your rhythm.

## Game Overview

In Run 3, you control a small grey alien who just wants to run. You start off in a 3D grey tunnel, running forward automatically. The tunnel is littered with various hazards and gaps, and it's your job to navigate your runner through these obstacles as you hurtle forward.

The game ramps up in difficulty as you progress, with more complex tunnel designs and additional challenges. However, the game’s core appeal remains its simplicity, making it a great pick-up-and-play game for those odd moments of downtime.

## Key Features

### Infinite Runner

Run 3 is an infinite runner. This means there's no end to the game – you simply run until you can't run anymore. This adds a layer of excitement and tension to the gameplay, as you're always striving to beat your previous high score.

### Easy Controls

You only need to use the arrow keys to control your alien. The simplicity of the controls makes the game easy to pick up, but the challenge lies in mastering the timing and anticipating the tunnel's twists and turns.

### Progression System

As you play, you collect power cells which can be used to unlock new characters and upgrades. This adds a sense of progression and satisfaction as you improve and unlock new content.

### Challenging Levels

While the gameplay sounds simple, don't be fooled. The levels in Run 3 steadily ramp up in difficulty, with more obstacles, faster running speeds, and trickier tunnel layouts to navigate.
